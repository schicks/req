synopsis: "A curl like tool that can run requests from files"
description:
  "I like saving requests to files so that I can version them and iterate on them. I don't like having to download and install Postman just to make HTTP requests. `req` makes HTTP requests from files following the [HTTP standard](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html) so I can pipe the results right into other tools."
